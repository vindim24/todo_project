# TODO Project

I used the <b>Bloc&Cubit</b> state managment for this project.

Also the prject contains some features:
 - Add, edit and remove tasks;
 - Search the special task;
 - Caching tasks into the phone;
 - Counter of active tasks that might be completed, but already not;
 - Filtering tasks by its status(active or completed)
